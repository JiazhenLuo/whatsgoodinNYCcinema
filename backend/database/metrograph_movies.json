        "overview_en": "Winner of the Best Director Award at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Reygadas’s fourth feature tells, through a daring, disorienting fragmented narrative structure, the story of a monied couple (Adolfo Jimenez Castro and Nathalia Acevedo) who decide to relocate with their two young children (Reygadas’s own son and daughter) to live a life of rural isolation in mountainous south-central Mexico—a decision with massive repercussions for their marriage, and for the inner lives of their offspring. Lush, mesmerizing, and confounding, existing in a fog-shrouded territory where memory, fantasy, and present-tense reality mingle, Reygadas’s divisive psychic self-portrait may be judged a triumph or a folly, but will leave no viewer indifferent.",

Perhaps Haneke’s ultimate directorial accomplishment—and, incidentally, a eulogy for the youthful dreams of the 1960s European art cinema.",

A psychological drama made with keen insight into the motives behind confession and suppression, with the unusual distinction of having both the Dardenne brothers, Florian Zeller, and Naomi Osaka among its producers.",

Featuring appearances by countercultural figures like poet Sakumi Hagiwara and activist/dancer Genshu Hanayagi, as well as freewheeling formal and stylistic experimentation, The Oldest Profession is among the boldest and most uncompromised of Roman Porno titles.",

Nominated for six Academy Awards, including a Best Editing nomination for Monika Willi, with whom Field spent long, secluded hours cutting the film at a 15th-century former nunnery outside Edinburgh, Scotland. “The biggest challenge,” Willi would say of the process, “was the overall musicality… To have one big piece made of a lot of smaller pieces and see that it never lost its tension.”",

Kinski plays a young woman newly arrived in New Orleans to reunite with long lost older brother Malcolm McDowell, only there to discover during visits to the zoo (and through a burgeoning relationship with zookeeper John Heard) that she’s inherited her family’s unusual affinity for large, predatory cats… Tawdry, transgressive, and transcendent filmmaking.",

A film of enormous pathos and easygoing humor which won Masina Best Actress honors at Cannes and gave a young Pier Paolo Pasolini an early screen credit, hired by Fellini for his intimate knowledge of the argot of Roman streets. “Fellini’s finest film.” —Pauline Kael, The New Yorker",

A delirious, audacious, and always unpredictable genre-bender that fuses parent-child melodrama, cyberpunk sci-fi, and serial killer movie shocker in a maverick film fable that’s as emotional as it is visceral.",

A warm, vibrant, and infinitely charming tale of loss and (literally) supernatural perseverance, featuring a cast loaded with top tier talent from the Francophone Caribbean, including legendary Guadeloupe group Kassav’, Pascal Légitimus of the French trio of humorists Les Inconnus, and jazz pianist Alain Jean-Marie.

Impressed by Palcy's commitment to human rights, Brando originally wanted to work for free but had to accept the union rate. “First-rate agitprop about the ruthlessness of South African apartheid… The relentless plot is effectively set up and expertly pursued.” —Jonathan Rosenbaum, The Chicago Reader",

A mordantly funny film on the topics of grief, longing, female flâneurism, death, and rebirth, featuring some of Tsai’s most exquisitely composed durational sequence shots.",

A deeply affecting and justly celebrated actors’ duet as well as a time capsule of late-’60s Times Square and downtown bohemia that still speaks volumes about the dirty business of eking out a living in a loud, ugly city that doesn’t know you’re alive and doesn’t care if you die.

Karina gives a performance of radiant fortitude as Suzanne Simonin, a young woman consigned by her family to take up the nun’s habit in spite of a lack of religious avocation, struggling to keep her faith and basic humanity intact while subjected to the capricious cruelty of higher-ups including Micheline Presle’s sadistic Mother Superior.",

The darkest of its director’s “hang out” movies, faintly pulsing with the ambient dread that comes of living in a landscape of superstores and subdivisions.",

Exploring the marginal lives of immigrant communities in Southeast Asia, Tsai makes potent usage of Kuala Lumpur locations, including, to stunning effect, an enormous, flooded construction site.",

Anticipating the lavish fantasias of Pierre et Gilles and arguably outdoing them, Bidgood’s newly restored lone feature, obsessive and intoxicating, is nothing less than “a benchmark of underground gay cinema.” [The New York Times]",

A perverse mash note to Golden Age Japanese cinema from the twilight of the Roman porno, which by the mid-’80s was facing stiff competition from home video.",

Influential for both revivifying the then-moribund Korean horror film and injecting it with a new streak of comic cruelty, The Quiet Family has been loosely remade—by Takashi Miike, for one—but arguably never topped for gruesome glee.",

A blunt-scented plunge into the lower depths of the Valley, a time capsule of early aughts youth culture, and a showcase for second-skin natural performances by Wood, Reed, and Hunter.",

An examination of the difficult relationship between religious submission and sexual liberation, featuring some of the most memorable foley sounds in recent cinema.",

An intoxicating swansong, and an apt end to a career defined by an ongoing tango between Eros and Thanatos.",

Working in the Roman Porno template, and paying sincere tribute to his forebears, Shiota has made a hysterical, free-associative slapstick sex comedy that includes a burlesqued threesome and a coupling that literally brings down the house.",

To design the marauding vessel discovered travelling inside the cloud, the alien-piloted “V’ger,” Mead, in his first piece of film concept art, worked with Roddenberry, Wise, and FX maestro Douglas Trumbull to help design what would become the 68’ V’ger model used on the shoot, following Wise’s directive to create something “no man had ever seen.”",

Unique in its examination of war guilt as experienced from a distance of two generations, Albert’s historical excavation drama is lent considerable momentum through Fischer’s live-wire performance, Willi’s reliably spry cutting, and Lorenz Dangel’s score.",

A disarmingly funny masterclass in less-is-more storytelling economy that is, in its final scene in the then-unfinished Daan Forest Park, utterly devastating.",

Enormously moving, while nimbly sidestepping cliché and cloying sentiment, and a paean to the natural beauty of the Whangara landscape. “Not a simplistic fable but the story of real people living in modern times… [Castle-Hughes] is a movie star. She glows.”—Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times",

A mesmerizing, gentle work of magic realism which, set in the 1940s, as industrialization has made inroads into even rural Ireland, old traditions are fading, and the equilibrium of the natural world is upset, also feels perfectly aligned to Sayles’s recurring thematic concerns.",

As photographed by the peerless Sven Nykvist, who spent a month studying how the light in the church that’s the film’s central location changed in the course of a day, Winter Light is a film of bleak beauty, a rigorously pared-down drama of the struggle to hold onto faith in the face of God’s silence.",

Rounding out the superb supporting players are the aliens themselves, pinnacles of pre-CGI visual effects that just keep coming, and coming, and coming, and coming… while Mead’s contributions can mostly be seen in the blade-like military vessel Sulaco and the unforgettable “Power Loader” donned by Ripley for the main event grudge match.",

Running in a new 4K restoration, with Solondz and cast and crew appearing in-person for a 20th Anniversary reunion screening. “Brave and challenging. The film has no heroes without flaws and no villains without virtues… Each individual story has an authenticity and impact of its own.” —Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times",

At once funny and shattering, Manuela’s journey is a paean to femininity in every form. An Oscar winner and massive across the board hit that brought Almodóvar mainstream acceptance.",
